# Attack of Slime

Welcome to the Tower of Slime! Get ready for some heart pounding four directional slime bashing action!

## About

Attack of slime is a 2d top-down game created using Cocos2d-x and C++ that I programmed in about two weeks. The starting point was: I had never used Cocos before, but I had C++ experience - I wanted to see if Cocos was a good platform for writing simple games. 

It's a pretty simple game, but in this case I wanted to concentrate on making something clean and well structured in a short ammount of time. This game could potentially be the base for something much larger (and if you'd like I encourage you to fork and expand on it!).

I believe the code is pretty well structured and easy to read, but ultimately I'd like to turn this into a tutorial, which is in part why it's up here on the GitHubs.

## How To Play

Attack of Slime is easy to play - use the WASD keys to move around the dungeon, and bash into slimes to attack them. Each slime takes two hits to kill. Slimes that get close enough will attack you and chip away at your health. When your health reaches zero, it's game over.

## Download

I'll have the download links here soon - I'm just testing to make sure it works at least on Windows 10 and to make sure there aren't any hidden dll dependencies (what's that? You don't test your games on a machine other than your dev machine?). A build for OS X may follow.
