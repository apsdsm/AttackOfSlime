# Attack of Slime

This is a temporary README.md file until the game is finished!

## About

Attack of slime is a 2d top-down game created using Cocos2d-x and C++. It's not quite complete, but I wanted to get a repo online so that I stopped feeling so nervous about making changes to the code.

## How To Play

I'll have information about this once you can download a stable release.

## Download

I'll have the download links here soonishly, I hope.
