# Attack of Slime

Welcome to the Tower of Slime! Get ready for some heart pounding four directional slime bashing action!

## About

Attack of slime is a 2d top-down game created using Cocos2d-x and C++ that I programmed in about two weeks. The starting point was: I had never used Cocos before, but I had C++ experience - I wanted to see if Cocos was a good platform for writing simple games. 

It's a pretty simple game, but in this case I wanted to concentrate on making something clean and well structured in a short ammount of time. This game could potentially be the base for something much larger (and if you'd like I encourage you to fork and expand on it!).

I believe the code is pretty well structured and easy to read, but ultimately I'd like to turn this into a tutorial, which is in part why it's up here on the GitHubs.

## Installation

### Windows

Before anything else, you may need to install the Microsoft C++ Redistributable on your system. You can download it from here:

[Microsoft C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

If you've already installed it previously, or your system has any kind of dev tools installed, this is probably not necessary, but in case you try get the game to run and it borks, this is almost certainly why.

Next, download the most recent build of the game from here:

[Attack of Slime v1.0](http://apsdsm.com/content/images/2015/12/attackofslime_gameplay01.gif)

Unzip the game someplace on your drive and double click the .exe to start playing.

## How To Play

Attack of Slime is easy to play - use the WASD keys to move around the dungeon, and bash into slimes to attack them. Each slime takes two hits to kill. Slimes that get close enough will attack you and chip away at your health. When your health reaches zero, it's game over.
